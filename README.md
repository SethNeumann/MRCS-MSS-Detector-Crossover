# Modular Signaling System Crossover board cpOD-M
## License: CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2


This Barry Draper design conforms to the 
[Modular Signaling System](http://modularsignalsystem.info/index.html)
(MSS) standard, first described by Greg Fuhriman in RMJ in the
1990s, as well as the proposed MSS 2.0 standard.  MSS is widely
used in the Free-mo world, but its also a great solution for a
layout needing basic ABS signaling.  A Crossover board is for a
non-signaled module (detection only).  The MSS Detector Crossover
Board includes a power supply that is fed by the Free-mo Aux Bus
(12 to 14 Volt AC or DCC) and has connectors to communicate with
two adjacent modules and a socket for current detector such as a
[cpOD-M](http://www.modelrailroadcontrolsystems.com/cpod-control-point-occupancy-detector/)
or Dr. Chubb's
[DCCOD](https://www.jlcenterprises.net/products/dcc-optimized-detector).
The MSS Crossover, a cpOD-M, and two straight-through network cables
are all you need to add signal detection to a single track Free-mo
module. (As expected, two of each would be needed for a double track
module.)
